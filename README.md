### What is a Tower Defense Script?  
A tower defense script is a pre-built code framework designed to streamline the creation of tower defense games. In these games, players strategically place defensive structures (towers) to prevent enemies (creeps) from reaching a goal. The script handles core mechanics like enemy pathfinding, tower targeting, wave spawning, and resource management, allowing developers to focus on customization and gameplay polish.
